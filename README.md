#  Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Prediction

This repository contains an end-to-end pipeline for predicting **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** using the [Online Retail Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/352/online+retail). The model leverages **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)** for prediction and utilizes **MLflow** for robust experiment tracking and reproducibility.

##  Overview

**Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** is a key business metric that estimates the total net profit attributed to the entire future relationship with a customer. Predicting CLV enables better:

- Marketing strategy formulation
- Customer segmentation
- Retention campaign targeting
- Revenue forecasting

This project includes data processing, modeling, training, evaluation, and experiment tracking.

##  Dataset Description

The **Online Retail Dataset** is a real-world e-commerce transaction dataset that contains:

- **Country**: Country of customer residence
- **InvoiceDate**: Date of transaction
- **CustomerID**: Unique identifier for each customer
- **InvoiceNo**: Unique invoice number per transaction
- **StockCode**: Product identifier
- **Description**: Product description
- **Quantity**: Quantity of items purchased
- **UnitPrice**: Price per item

##  Problem Statement

The goal is to predict the **monetary value of a customer's future purchases**, using historical data. We approach this as a **regression problem**, where the target is the total value a customer is expected to generate over a defined horizon.

##  Modeling Approach

###  Feature Engineering
Key features engineered include:
- Recency, Frequency, Monetary (RFM) metrics
- Customer tenure
- Purchase patterns
- Time-based aggregations

###  Model Architecture: Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
- Input layer aligned with number of engineered features
- 2–3 hidden layers with ReLU activation
- Output layer with linear activation for regression
- Optimized with Adam, MSE loss function

###  Training Pipeline
- Data preprocessing using `pandas` and `scikit-learn`
- Train/validation split
- Training monitored and logged with `MLflow`
- Model persisted and versioned for reproducibility

##  MLflow Tracking

MLflow is used to:
- Log metrics like loss, MAE, RMSE
- Track hyperparameters
- Save and register models
- Compare different model runs visually

Example:
```bash
mlflow ui
Access the MLflow dashboard at http://localhost:5000 to explore and compare experiments.

Results
The ANN-based model demonstrated strong generalization capability, especially when fine-tuned with:

Proper scaling and feature normalization

Balanced mini-batches during training

Dropout regularization to prevent overfitting

Future Improvements
Integrate RFM-based customer segmentation prior to modeling

Use sequence models (RNNs) for purchase pattern learning

Deploy the model as a REST API with FastAPI or Flask
